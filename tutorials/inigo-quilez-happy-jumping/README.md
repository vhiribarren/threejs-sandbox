# Tutorials: Inigo Quilez Happy Jumping

## About

This work was done by watching the work of Inigo Quilez, in the following
place: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfe5UQ-1L9Q

The work started using Rust, Bevy and WGSL as a native program. Unfortunately,
one SDF comparison between an ellipsoid and other components made the shader and
computer crash, and I did not managed to solve the issue. So I did converted the
last work to GLSL and continue the tutorial with a web browser setup.

It uses Vite and Three.js with React Three Fiber.

## How to start

    npm run dev

The shader was written and adapted by me by watching the video tutorial for
educational purpose. It largely copies line of codes displayed in the video
and it reproduces a final piece of code implementing a work of art. As such,
Inigo Quilez is the sole owner of this art work, you are not allowed to use
